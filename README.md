# Format D source code in Sublime Text

## dfmt-sublime

Integration of [**dfmt**](https://github.com/Hackerpilot/dfmt) with Sublime Text 2/3.

**Note 1:** You need `dfmt` placed in your PATH.

**Note 2:** Specify path to your [.editorconfig](https://github.com/Hackerpilot/dfmt/blob/master/.editorconfig) file (`Preferences` -> `Package Settings` -> `DFormat` -> `Settings - Default`)

**Note 3:** I have only Windows, so can't test it on other systems...

**Note 4:** I have no experience with Python before.


## Installation

Please use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/DFormat).
